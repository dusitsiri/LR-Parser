# LR Parser (LR(0), SLR(1), CLR(1) and LALR(1))
[LR Parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LR_parser) are buttom-up parser for reading grammar. There are different kinds of LR Parser which some of them are: SLR parsers, LALR parsers, Canonical LR(1) parsers.

I implemented these parser algorithms using java and add gui for using it more convenient.It's very simple first you enter your context-free grammar choose the parser(LR(0), SLR(1), CLR(1) and LALR(1)). Then, you can see all the property of the parsed grammar (Augmented Grammar, First Sets, Follow Sets, Canonical Collection, Go To Table, Action Table) by clicking on the corresponding button. Also, you can give different input and check whether grammar accept the string or not.

here is a screenshot from the application:
